After 10 yrs of working as an educator, I decided to make a daring career change to transition into a more technical role. I constantly felt the need to be challenged and engaged and longed for a work environment that created opportunities for learning new things. 

As an undegraduate student pursuing a degree in Mathematics, I completed quite a number computer and programming courses, and always excelled in them, so anything that involved coding seemed like a good fit for my new career! I tried to learn as much as I can and attended Meetups and various programs in coding, databases, and data science, so that I may become more familiar the current technologies than those I was introduced to more than a decade before. 

I am also an Electrician in the US Navy Reserves, in an engineering group known as the Seabees.
