I am in the process of creating my site using Jekyll. This is my first post! 

I am officially a Senior with Hack Reactor, currently in the 7th week of the program. During the first 6 weeks were quite intensive, as there was so much to learn! I plan to use these last 6 weeks refining my skills, and using my blogs as a medium for reviewing course content.

Hope you enjoy my posts.
