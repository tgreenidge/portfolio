For the first couple of days at Hack Reactor, we have been focusing on polishing our resumes. That coupled with the fact that I listed my domain on my Greenfield Group Project site, is driving me to get my site up and running. I now have projects that I want to show to the world, but unfortunately, it's not going as smoothly as I would like.

### Google.com Domain
Did you know that Google now sells domains? I purchased my domain from Google after learning that GoDaddy would charge me $103, because I previously had a domain through them that expired. I am no longer eligible for their awesome discounts - ughh. My domain purchased through Google only cost me around $12 per year, with the following features as extracted from [Google Domains Help page](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6010092?hl=en):

  >Features included at no additional cost

  >Whois privacy

  >Domain forwarding and subdomain forwarding

  >Email forwarding (forwarding of email aliases @<your domain>)

  >Google nameservers with 10 million DNS resolutions per year

  >Support via help center, email, chat, or phone. 

While I may not have use for email fowarding just yet, it is a nice to have. However, the Whois privacy is an amazing (FREE) feature that allows me to hide and protect my personal information that is associated wirh my domain since I am the owner of the domain. When queried, all my personal info, with the exception of my name, points to a third party company in New Zealand.
